# First-Project
This is my first project putting html, css, and react together. The project was done in a small window, like half of a screen, and is not responsive for now, so spacing might be a little off if viewed in a full window.
Please understand that I am just trying to learn and will not appreciate disrespect. I simply want to learn how to be the best developer I can be. I know I am very far from that, but I hope i can get constructive criticism on what
to change and things to learn.
